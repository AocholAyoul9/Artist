      <h1>About the Artist</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Alex Morgan, a professional artist with over 10 years of
        experience in various mediums. My work explores the relationship between
        nature and human emotion.
      </p>

      <h2>Artistic Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Graduated from the Art Institute of Chicago in 2012, I've since
        exhibited in galleries across the country. My work has been featured in
        Art Monthly and Contemporary Art Review.
      </p>

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        "I believe art should provoke emotion and conversation. Every stroke
        carries intention, every color evokes feeling."
      </p>
